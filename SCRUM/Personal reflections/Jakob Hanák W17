What do I want to learn or understand better?

Same as last week since I have not fully grasped it. I want to learn how to connect back-end with front-end. Also, it would be nice to
learn how to know which step to do first in this process and how to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

To organize and help out with structure within the group. In some sense you could say that I can help out with the logistics of the team,
with meeting an such.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Making sure that we are on the right track and that everyone is taking responsibility for their respective role in Scrum.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Making sure that we are done before the deadline and communicate with our product owner. Also making sure that everything
looks as it is supposed to before presentation.
