what do I want to learn or understand better? 

- I want to understand the way to save the data coming from API in a Java object so that dealing with it becomes 
flexible. I think this problem has something to do with parallel programming, which I haven't studied yet but am 
trying to learn. 

 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

- I can first explain in words. If the person who needs help does not understand what I am talking about, I can 
explain how it works in practice. Also I can send some youtube videos that explain better than me. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 

- I am a member of the development team. what I contribute to the group's use of scrum is that I stick to deadlines 
and tasks we have taken on during each sprint. I can say too that I'm good at GitHub, so when a group member needs 
help on GitHub, they come to me. I'm also trying to resolve merger conflicts in Github. In addition, I organize 
the group's meeting times. 

 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

This sprint I have coded and finished my own tasks and helped others finish theirs.
