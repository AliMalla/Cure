what do I want to learn or understand better? 

-I want to update my information and strengthen my skills in Android. Also I want to 
learn how we can use an API so that we can use it in our project instead of building 
a data from scratch. 

 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

-I can first explain in words. If the person who needs help does not understand what 
I am talking about, I can explain how it works in practice. Also I can send some youtube 
videos that explain better than me. 

 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 

-I am a member of the development team. 

 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

-I have created a simple interface to be able to test whether the connection to the API 
that we use works and to make it easier for the customer to see the value provided to 
him. I've also read the API-documentation so that i understand how to implement it.
