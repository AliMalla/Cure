Week5 

what do I want to learn or understand better? 

- I want to update my information and strengthen my skills in Android. 

 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

- I can first explain in words. If the person who needs help does not understand what 
I am talking about, I can explain how it works in practice. Also I can send some youtube 
videos that explain better than me.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

can delete a recipe and the other to see the total nutrients that he has eaten in a certain
day.
