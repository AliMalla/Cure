Week8 

what do I want to learn or understand better? 

- this week I haved learned to marge every day after the implementation of user stories. 
That worked well for me and better than merging all implemented user stories at the end 
of the sprint. In the next week , I want to learn how to present the product I have made 
to the stakeholders. On monday, We will present the application and make some demo which 
will teach me more about how to introduce the product as well. 

 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

- I can first explain in words. If the person who needs help does not understand what I am 
talking about, I can explain how it works in practice. Also I can send some youtube videos 
that explain better than me. This week, Nobody asked me to learn anything new except github 
stuff because our app was almost ready.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 

- I am a member of the development team. what I contribute to the group's use of scrum is 
that I stick to deadlines and tasks we have taken on during each sprint. I can say too 
that I'm good at GitHub, so when a group member needs help on GitHub, they come to me. 
I'm also trying to resolve merger conflicts in Github. 

 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

This sprint I have coded and finished my own tasks.
