-What do I want to learn or understand better? 

I want to learn the principles of Agile and work with scrum so that I can work flexibly
with a project. 

 

-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

I can first explain in words. If the person who needs help does not understand
what I am talking about, I can explain how it works in practice. 

 

-What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 

- I do not know yet because I do not know much about scrum. But after attending
a few more lectures, I can contribute. 

 

-What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

I have created a server in discord so we can communicate with each other there. Then 
I created a repo in github to add all the materials and added the group members to the
repo. As we wrote the social contract together.
