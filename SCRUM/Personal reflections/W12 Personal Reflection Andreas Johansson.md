-   what do I want to learn or understand better?
  To better be able to help and guide the group i want to learn the SCRUM methods and the Agile way.
-   how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  At this early stage i can aid my colleagues with setting up the tools we are going to use.
-   what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  I am going to call our first meeting on monday to set up goals for the week.
-   what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  The team doesn't deliver more than what i contribute, so i have a large part to play in the team's deliveries. This week, we have not delivered so much perse, but we have agreed on a social contract and with this retrospective, the first week is done.
