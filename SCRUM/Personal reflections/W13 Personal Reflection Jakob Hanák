What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn the Java language better and understand the processes of 
developing software – from idea to product. Would also be nice to learn some 
about API and how to use them. I definitely need to improve my skills with 
GitHub as well, it is a bit rusty at the moment.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

With my limited experience with programming – compared to the rest of the group 
that is - I believe that the best way I can help my group is with communication and 
organization of the project ahead.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Probably the best fit for me is to contribute with the structure and organization 
of the team’s use of Scrum. I will also be handling a major part of the communication 
with the product owner.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Making sure that everything is working beforehand and to create a good presentation, 
well packaged. Most likely will I also do some final polishes every week on our product
to make sure that it runs properly, and everything in the application looks the way our 
product owner expects it to.
