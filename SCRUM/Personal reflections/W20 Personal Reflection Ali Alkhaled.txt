What do I want to learn or understand better?

-I want to learn more about how to make a good technical documentation and use the knowledge I have learnt from this course in my next projects.  



How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

-Most important, by doing code reviews frequently, especially now when the product should be completely done very soon. Articles about Agile development.



What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

-Im a developer in the team. I still try to get some knowledge about other roles.



What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

-I fixed some issues depending on feedback the team got from the Product Owner. Also, I made the daily eaten list dynamic and the whole application very quicky since it was very slow because of the limited number of API requests that we can do per minute. I worked even with deleting a recipe and updating the listview as fast something has happened.
