What do I want to learn or understand better?

I have learned a bit about API and the basics of how to use GitHub and potential merge conflicts that may arise.
However I would like to improve this even further, since it is a big part of our project to understand and use the both of them.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can help my team by taking some workload off, since I have a bit more spare time than them. (Have people with fulltime jobs
and double courses)

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I am organizing a lot and making sure that our Trello board is up to date and tidy.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Organizing and making sure that we deliver both personal and group assignments on time.
