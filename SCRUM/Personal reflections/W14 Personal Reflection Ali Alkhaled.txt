What do I want to learn or understand better?

I have learned new things about the API that is going to be used in application, but I think I need to improve myself in this point a little bit.




How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

-By discussing and explaining the server model that I have developed until now based on the model schema from API.




What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

-I am a developer, and I feel it is the best fit for me. I am looking forward to continually be active in the technical development of the application.



What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

-I have been coding some backend/server side. Not done yet.
